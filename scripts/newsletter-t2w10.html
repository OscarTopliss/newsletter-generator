									<h1>Help, I'm Trapped in a Newsletter Writing Factory | Newsletter T2 W10</h1>
<p>Unfortunately I made some poor decisions and got reelected as secretary. That's a terrible shame, because you've all signed yourself up for another year of insane newsletters, but let's be honest, who actually reads these anyway?</p>
<p>As always, we have our wonderful Welfare Officers here to help you if you encounter any issues: Thomas (@tomo.li) and Raven (@raven0034)</p>

<h1><a href="https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t2/w10/dcs-end-of-term-social/">🎉 DCS End of Term Social 🎉</a></h1>
<h4>🕘Wednesday 12th March 2pm - 5pm📍<a href="https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/66167610d8dbf518cbed2bfb?projectId=warwick">Bar Fusion/Esports Centre</a></h4>
<h4><em>The end is near</em></h4>
<p>The end of term is nearly here! And that means only one thing - no, not more deadlines - it's time for DCS' end of term social!</p>
<p>This term we'll be in Bar Fusion and the Esports centre, with acess to the Esports machines and consoles. DCS are also handing out a Fusion voucher to buy food and drink.</p>
<p>From 4pm, we'll be hosting a quiz with some fun prizes, so stick around to the end!</p>

<h4>🕘Thursday 13th March 7:15pm-9pm📍<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yxSrkAJfdHS7dgxBA">SHIN restaurant</a></h4>
<h4><em>NUCLEAR SUCCESS</em></h4>
<p>We are going to <strong>SHIN Japanese Kitchen &amp; Bar</strong>, and will consume an inconceivable amount of food which may actually be slightly healthy for once because it's <strong>East Asian cuisine</strong>!😱</p>
<p>Check out their menu <a href="https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/coventry/coventry-city-centre/shin-ramen">here</a>!</p>
<p>Interested in coming? Fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/MpU36Cjs2KqBiRUh8">this interest form</a></p>
<p><strong>If you want a 10% DISCOUNT</strong> (which let's be honest who doesn't) <strong>MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH</strong> since they give a discount on cash (there is an ATM just by the restaurant).</p>
<p>The bus times will be sent out closer to the day, but <em>we are wanting to get there and sat down for 7:15pm</em>, so you have been warned.</p>

<p>Well I guess my heartfelt sign off from last week was redundant as I'm back... Can't wait for sleep-deprived, exam-stress-fuelled, insane term 3 newsletters season 2! - Ray</p>
